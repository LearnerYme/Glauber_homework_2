# Glauber_homework_2

***

**Update: 2020. 10. 27**

Sample the theta angle with sin(theta), and sample the rho length with rho^2*Woods_Saxon(rho), and the plot of Ncoll would be right.

BTW, phi angle using uniform is okay.

Homework of Introduction to High Energy Nucleon Physics, chapter 2: Glauber Model.

This repository only for my High Energy Nucleon Physics homework. Indeed, a new version, absolutely new.

Monte-Carlo Glauber would show too high Ncoll and I cannot figure out why would that happen. However, other part of homework seems to be okay.
