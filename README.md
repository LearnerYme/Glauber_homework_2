#Glauber_homework_2

Homework of Introduction to High Energy Nucleon Physics, chapter 2: Glauber Model.

This repository only for my High Energy Nucleon Physics homework. Indeed, a new version, absolutely new.

Monte-Carlo Glauber would show too high Ncoll and I cannot figure out why would that happen. However, other part of homework seems to be okay.
